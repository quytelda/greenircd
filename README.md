# greenircd
Python Internet Relay Chat server implemented using the Twisted framework.

## Features
* Speed: IRC should be snappy, and not take 5 minutes to connect.
* Portability: Plant it anywhere!  Works out of the box!
* Simplicity: Since when did IRC need 80 channel modes, 60 user modes, and 14 levels of operator access?
* Modularity: Easily customize by adding and removing the features you *actually* want - without recompiling.
